# dr-beans-emporium-landing
This project is a landing page for a fictional store Dr Beans Beans Emporium.
This is a code academy project and the purpose is to get more practice with flexbox and 
CSS in general. 
The Commits will be relatively low because I coded this not intending to upload to Github but after finishing I decided I liked it enough to upload it.
